# PWmodernizer

> An LLM-driven pipeline that turns bad Playwright tests into clean modern Playwright TypeScript. Cypress and Selenium support land in Step 2 and Step 3.

**Honest scope:** PWmodernizer is _assistive scaffolding_, not a deterministic test framework migrator. Each migration produces a markdown plan + generated code + a metrics report. **Human review is required** before merge. Quality target: 70% acceptable rate on the bad-Playwright corpus before opening Step 2 (Cypress).

## Why this exists

Existing tools either (a) trap you in a proprietary DSL (testRigor, Mabl, Functionize), or (b) do syntax-only mechanical conversion (cy2pw — _archived by the Playwright team in Sept 2025_). No serious source-code-in → source-code-out migrator exists for Playwright. We emit standard `.spec.ts` files you own, with a complete audit trail.

Research backing this approach: Google FSE 2025 (`arxiv:2504.09691`) demonstrated multi-stage LLM-driven migration at scale, but **only 36% of changes landed pure-LLM** — 38% required human polish, 25% were human-only. We design accordingly — humans gate every stage in v0.

## Phased build plan

| Step | Source framework | Status | Target rollout |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Step 1** | Bad / outdated Playwright TypeScript | 🚧 In progress | v0 |
| Step 2 | Cypress | ⏸ Pending Step 1 quality bar | v1 |
| Step 3 | Selenium WebDriver (Java + Python) | ⏸ Pending DOM-grounding via playwright-mcp | v2 |

The repo ships knowledge-base and rule content for **all 4** sources (bad-Playwright, Cypress, Selenium Java, Selenium Python) because they share most anti-pattern categories. The pipeline workflows fire on any input file regardless of subfolder. But our **quality bar gate is Step 1 only**: until we hit 70% acceptable migrations on bad-Playwright, we won't promote the other sources beyond example status.

### Why this shape (the research distilled)

- **2-stage plan → code** instead of one-shot: Stage 1 produces an auditable plan that humans can edit. Stage 2 follows that plan literally. This is the only LLM-only pattern that delivers _auditability_ (true determinism with LLMs is a myth — see `arxiv:2410.10628`).
- **Validation cascade** after generation: tsc → eslint --fix → playwright parse → AST diff non-trivial → metrics. Per Google FSE 2025, multi-gate validation > prompt tuning.
- **Confidence-aware routing**: cheap default (Sonnet), expensive verifier (Opus) only fires when needed. Multi-model consensus (CANDOR pattern, `arxiv:2506.02943`) filters hallucinations that prompt engineering can't.
- **Reference style file**: `examples/reference/company-style.spec.ts` is the gold-standard target the migrator anchors output style on. Sogeti Skills methodology — the only honest published pattern in the AI-testing market.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Node 22+
- GitHub repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
  - **`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`** — **required**. Generate locally via `claude setup-token` in a real terminal (requires Claude Pro/Max). The token leverages your existing subscription; no separate Anthropic API billing. Alternative: use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from https://console.anthropic.com/ — to switch, replace `claude_code_oauth_token:` with `anthropic_api_key:` in the `with:` blocks of `.github/workflows/{plan,migrate,verify}.yml`.
  - `MIGRATION_TARGET_URL` — _optional_. If set, generation can ground locators against the live DOM via `playwright-mcp` (planned for v1; for v0 it's not yet wired).

### Trigger your first migration

1. Drop a bad Playwright spec into `inputs/bad-playwright/your-test.spec.ts`.
2. Commit and push.
3. **Stage 1 (`plan.yml`) fires automatically.** It produces `outputs/plans/your-test.spec.ts.md` and opens a PR labeled `migrator:plan`.
4. **Review the plan.** Read every row in the locator translation table. Pay attention to MED and LOW confidence entries — these are the LLM's best guesses and may be wrong.
5. Edit the plan in the PR if needed. The plan is a contract — Stage 2 follows it literally.
6. Merge the plan PR.
7. **Stage 2 (`migrate.yml`) fires automatically** on the merge. It produces:
   - `outputs/tests/your-test.spec.ts` — the migrated Playwright code
   - `outputs/tests/pages/*.page.ts` and `outputs/tests/fixtures/*.fixture.ts` — only if the plan said extract them
   - `outputs/reports/your-test.spec.ts.md` — metrics report
   - A second PR labeled `migrator:code` with the generated files
8. **Review the code PR.** The PR description shows aggregate confidence + which validation gates passed. Read the migration report — selector quality score, smell deltas, AST-diff non-trivial flag.
9. Pull the branch locally. Run `npx playwright test outputs/tests/your-test.spec.ts` against your staging app. Verify it catches the same bug class as the source did.
10. Merge or send back for regeneration with feedback.

## Quality gates (what the pipeline enforces)

Stage 2 will NOT open a code PR if any of these fail:

- `tsc --noEmit` passes (strict mode, no `any`)
- `eslint --fix` produces no remaining errors
- `npx playwright test --list` enumerates the generated spec (it parses as a real Playwright test)
- AST-diff-not-trivial check: rejects "migrations" where ≥80% of source bytes appear verbatim in the output (cosmetic-only fix)
- No forbidden patterns: `waitForTimeout`, `force: true`, `.nth()`, `test.only`, `test.skip`, `page.pause()`, `: any`, `as unknown as`, `console.log`

Stage 2 emits aggregate confidence (0..1):

- **≥ 0.7**: opens code PR for human review.
- **< 0.7**: triggers `verify.yml` (Opus second opinion). The verify report comments on the code PR; if it produces a `block` verdict, the code PR is labeled `verify:block` until a human resolves it.

The aggregate confidence formula:
```
0.6 × plan_confidence + 0.3 × selector_quality + 0.1 × web_first_rate
```

## Known limitations (read before opening issues)

- **Pure-LLM landed rate is 36%** in Google's industrial study. Plan accordingly — you WILL spend time reviewing.
- **Selector hallucinations** are the #1 failure mode without DOM access. Until `playwright-mcp` grounding lands in v1, every locator that wasn't a direct ID/testid translation carries LOW or MED confidence by design.
- **Magic Number Test smell** appears in 99.85% of LLM-generated unit tests (`arxiv:2410.10628`). We post-process with smell detection but don't promise to catch all instances.
- **Pre-existing test failures in your target app** make pass/fail signal unreliable. Record a baseline before migrating.
- **Selenium Java/Python are Step 3** for a reason — no public migrator exists for them. The cross-language + cross-paradigm gap is real. We mark every Selenium locator as LOW confidence.
- **CodeBLEU is NOT used as a quality metric** — research (`arxiv:2506.06767`) showed it penalizes good renames. We use selector quality + smell deltas + AST non-triviality instead.

## Costs

The pipeline uses Anthropic prompt caching. Knowledge-base + migration-rules + reference style (~13k tokens combined) cache at 0.1× the input price. A typical 60-line bad-Playwright migration costs roughly:

- Stage 1 (Sonnet): ~0.05 USD
- Stage 2 (Sonnet): ~0.10 USD
- Verify (Opus, only ~25% of migrations): ~0.30 USD

Realistic: **$0.15–0.40 per migration**, ceiling $0.50.

## Anti-patterns we explicitly do NOT promise

The commercial AI testing market is full of these. Migrator does not do them:

- ❌ "Full code export" theatre (the export is unmaintainable)
- ❌ NL-DSL lock-in (output is real Playwright TypeScript)
- ❌ Self-healing oversold ("works on minor changes" is the disclaimer hidden in their FAQs)
- ❌ Hidden per-seat / per-run / per-SKU pricing (we are OSS)
- ❌ Live-mode "AI fixing flaky tests in your CI" — that's a different product

## Contributing

PRs that improve `config/migration-rules.md`, `config/knowledge-base.md`, `examples/reference/company-style.spec.ts`, or `prompts/*.md` directly improve every future migration. PRs that add new validation gates to `scripts/` raise the quality floor.

PRs that add a new input source (Cypress, Selenium) should also include 2+ seed examples in `examples/` and unlock the gate in `README.md` only after the bad-Playwright corpus hits the 70% bar.
